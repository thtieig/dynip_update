Here a script that Iâ€™ve created to update your Dynamic DNS service.
You can run it manually or put in cron to run every few minutes.
It sends the update ONLY if the IP has changed. So you will avoid any "abuse" error, in case of too many attempts to update the IP.

This script currently works with Internet.bs and NO-IP.com services.

It requires curl package.
Tested on Raspberry Pi and Debian stable distros.

This is composed by 2 files:
* Config file: */etc/dynip_update.conf*
* Script file: */usr/local/bin/dynip_update*



### What is this repository for? ###

### How do I get set up? ###

* Configuration: copy the config file in */etc/* and the script into */usr/local/bin/*
* Dependencies: *curl, dig, sendmail*


### Who do I talk to? ###
